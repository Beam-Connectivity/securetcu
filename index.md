### Project Summary

The SecureTCU project will take cyber security for TCUs to the next level by integrating security innovations and validating the design through a new, regulations-aligned process.

The output from the project will be a hardened, market-ready automotive Telematics module (TCU) with embedded intrusion detection capabilities (IDS). This will offer class-leading protection from attacks launched over wireless interfaces, which is increasingly the dominant attack vector.


### Consortium Partners

This project is made possible by the collaboration of the consortium members from the United Kingdom and Republic of Korea:
